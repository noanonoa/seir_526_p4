# Project 4 Pitch
- Name of App: TBD
- Name: Noa Kim
- D3.js on React.js
### How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology?
The plan is to read D3.js documentation and explore cool ways to visualize an accounting spreadsheet.  The initial research would be to look for inspiring visuals that would make sense for budgeting and financing and dive in to details.  I may utilize youtube videos for tutorials should they be available.
### What is your goal with this project?
I have been using excel spreadsheets for my personal accounting.  Whether it be logging my daily spendings to track financial habits or setting up budget for any goals.  The problem is I'm tired of looking at the same boring pie chart to visualize spreadsheet data.  The goal is to create an app that will visualize my finances in a way that is alarming if the spending is dangerous or supportive if the spending is profitable.
### Who is the user for your app?
Myself and anyone else interested in visual accounting
### Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into?
Implementing new, unfamiliar technology is always challenging so I expect nothing less from D3 on React.  Initial roadblocks may include time constraints, integration (syntax, i/o, etc.), and resource availability.
